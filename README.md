# Paper 884  

This Python code is a supplementary material for Paper ID: 884.  

The following Python packages are used: 
random, numpy, collections, keras, sklearn, functools, matplotlib, math.

The code performs training and evaluation, and the default data set is the Glaucoma data set. We performed the grid search to fix all numerous hyper-parameters, however, we used the same values across all tested data sets. The hyper-parameters used can be found in the code. 
The aim of the current contribution is the introduction of novel methodology, which is mathematically sound, and its validation. Although we are aware that a highly optimised implementation is practical, and it is our priority for future work, it was not our goal for the current contribution which is focused on statistically sound models and the algorithm. 

We run the numerical experiments on a MacBook Pro, 2.6GHz 6â€‘core Intel Core i7, 16GB memory.
